## Progetti

### Modalità di realizzazione dei progetti 

Tutti i progetti prevedono la scrittura, utilizzando il linguaggio Python, di:

* un programma, sotto forma di notebook Jupyter, che richiami e integri tra loro funzionalità di Machine Learning offerte dalle librerie software adottate;
* una relazione esaustiva, che può essere integrata all'interno del notebook stesso, che illustri le caratteristiche del problema affrontato e le soluzioni adottate, con una discussione dei risultati ottenuti; 

La dimensione standard dei gruppi è pari a due. In casi particolari è possibile prevedere, se motivata, la possibilità di dimensioni diverse da quanto specificato.

Oltre ai possibili progetti elencati di seguito, ulteriori progetti potranno essere proposti da parte di studenti interessati a tematiche qui non considerate 

 
### Progetti proposti

Per gruppi composti da 2 studenti

- 1 Twitter sentiment analysis [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/twitter-sentiment-analysis2/overview)

*The task is to build a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative) of the text. To do this, you will need to train the model on the existing data (train.csv). The resulting model will have to determine the class (neutral, positive, negative) of new texts (test data that were not used to build the model) with maximum accuracy.*




- 2 Higgs Boson [Link1](https://higgsml.lal.in2p3.fr/documentation/) 

*Classification problem to distinguish between a signal process which produces Higgs bosons and a background process which does not. The goal of the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge is to explore the potential of advanced machine learning methods to improve the discovery significance of the experiment. No knowledge of particle physics is required. Using simulated data with features characterizing events detected by ATLAS, your task is to classify events into "tau tau decay of a Higgs boson" versus "background."*


- 3 Fifty Victorian Era Novelists Authorship Attribution Data ﻿ [Link](https://dataworks.iupui.edu/handle/11243/23)

*Authorship attribution is the process of identifying the author of a given text and from the machine learning perspective, it can be seen as a classification problem.*

- 4 Music genre recognition [Link](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/www-2018-challenge-learning-to-recognize-musical-genre)

*The task of this challenge, one of the four official challenges of the Web Conference (WWW2018) challenges track, is to recognize the musical genre of a piece of music of which only a recording is available. Genres are broad, e.g. pop or rock, and each song only has one target genre. The data for this challenge comes from the recently published FMA dataset, which is a dump of the Free Music Archive (FMA), an interactive library of high-quality and curated audio which is freely and openly available to the public.*


- 5 Audio features of songs ranging from 1922 to 2011 [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/msd-audio-features)

*Use this dataset to predict the years that each song was released based on it's audio features*


- 6 Tappy Keystroke Data with Parkinson's Patients [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/valkling/tappy-keystroke-data-with-parkinsons-patients)

*The dataset contains keystroke logs collected from over 200 subjects, with and without Parkinson's Disease (PD), as they typed normally on their own computer (without any supervision) over a period of weeks or months (having initially installed a custom keystroke recording app, Tappy). This dataset has been collected and analyzed in order to indicate that the routine interaction with computer keyboards can be used to detect changes in the characteristics of finger movement in the early stages of PD.*


- 7 Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

*Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.*



- 8 Activity molecule against HIV infection [Link](https://codalab.lri.fr/competitions/9)

*The objective is to predict which compounds are active against the AIDS HIV infection. The dataset has two classes : active or inactive (Binary Classification). The variables represent properties of the molecule inferred from its structure. The problem is therefore to relate structure to activity (a QSAR=quantitative structure - activity relationship problem) to screen new compounds before actually testing them (a HTS=High Throughput Screening problem).*



- 9 Merck Molecular Activity Challenge [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/description)

*When developing new medicines it is important to identify molecules that are highly active toward their intended targets but not toward other targets that might cause side effects. The objective of this competition is to identify the best statistical techniques for predicting biological activities of different molecules, both on- and off-target, given numerical descriptors generated from their chemical structures*
